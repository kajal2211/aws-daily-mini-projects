# aws-daily-mini-projects
Welcome to my AWS daily mini-projects repository! This collection represents my journey of learning and mastering AWS through hands-on experience. Each day, I explore a new AWS service or feature by building small, practical projects that solve real-world problems.
The repository is structured with a separate folder for each day, containing:

Code: Scripts, configuration files (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation), or Python/Node.js code.
Project Documentation: Each project includes a detailed README file, outlining the goal, AWS services used, step-by-step implementation, and key takeaways.
Screenshots/Diagrams (where applicable): Visuals to help illustrate the infrastructure or key results of the project.
The goal of these mini-projects is to deepen my understanding of AWS services, from S3 and EC2 to Lambda, IAM, and beyond. I also aim to build a solid foundation in infrastructure as code (IaC), automation, and cloud security. By documenting the challenges and lessons learned, this repository serves as a knowledge base for anyone starting with AWS or looking for practical examples of cloud solutions.
